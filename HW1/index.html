            <h3> My plans for the future</h3>
            <p> My current plans for the future regarding what I have learned is to work in the field. I have
                no preference for where I work at currently and just want to start working. Even if I do not 
                start my career immediately, I will be taking certifications for languages like C# and C++ 
                and also other ones like the A+ and cybersecurity certification. Hopefully, I will be able to apply
                knowledge I learn from classes like Web Dev to be able to advance my career in the future. Though
                I am not too sure of what I will do, I have confidence that I will be able to work it out somehow.

            <h3> Code Snippet </h3>
            <p> Below is a code snippet from my Algorithms class, this is written in C#.</p>
            <code><pre>
                static int FirstFit(int[] weight, int maxWeight)
                {
                    int bin = 1, binSize = maxWeight;
                    Array.Sort(weight);
                    for (int i = 0; i < weight.Length; i++)
                    {
                        if (binSize - weight[i] < 0)
                        {
                            bin++;
                            binSize = maxWeight;
                            binSize = binSize - weight[i];
                        }
                        else
                            binSize = binSize - weight[i];
                    }
                    return bin;
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                What this code does it is creating a firstfit alogrithm for the bin packing problem. First Fit is a Heuristic Solution 
                as it will solve the problem and give the total number of boxes needed at a much faster rate, but it will not
                be as efficient of a solution when comparing to a heuristic solution. This code will return the total number of bins needed
                to fit n boxes that will fill k size of the box.
