Wcat: this program will take the input (after g++) 
./wcat test.txt
This will do a couple things.
First it will read the txt file and display exactly what is being said in the file.
It was texted by using the said txt file above. 
No bugs have been noted in the program, though it does look messy.

wgrep: This program will take the input (after g++)
.wgrep hello test.txt
This will take the txt and look for any specific lines that have the word "hello".
It will display the line is has the word in it.
Tested by using a txt file with the word hello, and aaaaaaaaabbbb on the other line. 
It worked properly.
Looks messy.

wzip: Takes input:
./wzip test.txt > test.z
This will take the file and compress it into a compressed file (a zip).
If it is not compressed it will compress it so each letter appears once. 
Program looks messy. 
Tested using a txt file and compressing it.

wunzip: takes input
./wunzip test.z
Will uncompress the file and display the entire file.
Will display everything that is in the txt file. 
Messy program, it runs properly.
Tested with a z file made with wzip.
